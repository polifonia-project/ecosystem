The Polifonia Ontology Network (PON) provides a modular backbone of music
ontologies to address both cultural heritage and more general queries in the
music domain. As illustrated in the diagram below, `PON v1.0` comprises 15
ontology module that are organised thematically (colours, horizontal view) and
hierarchically, to highlight their dependencies (vertical view). At the bottom
of the architecture lies our `Core` module (providing general-purpose elements
of design, ODPs, and alignments) and the reused ontologies. Four foundational
models provide interoperability across PON through their abstract design:
`Source`, `Instrument`, `Music Meta`, and `Music Representation`. These are
specialised and extended in the upper levels to add functionalities and
contextualise specific domains.

A summary of PON modules is given in the table below, with links to the
repositories storing the modules with documentation, diagrams, and examples.
Through our foundational models, PON ontologies can be applied to a wide set of
music projects, and the modular design simplifies extensibility and maintenance.
