The Bells Ontology opens the door to a fascinating world of bells, bell towers, and bell ringers. At the heart of this module lies a meticulous description of bells, capturing their essence through measurable, intrinsic aspects like weight, materials, and conservation status.

When it comes to bells, their significance is not confined to mere objects; it extends to the rich history and culture they represent. The Bells Ontology enables the documentation of crucial historical data, such as authorship attribution and dating, providing a comprehensive understanding of these resonating treasures. Additionally, this module thoughtfully considers the techniques used in bell execution, recognizing the artistry and craftsmanship involved in creating their melodious tones.

The Bells Ontology is directly reuses the [ArCo ontology](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/). Leveraging and expanding upon the existing ArCo modules, this ontology ensures **compatibility** and **interoperability**, making it a valuable asset for researchers and historians.
