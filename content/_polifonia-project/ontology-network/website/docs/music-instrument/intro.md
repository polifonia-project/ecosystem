The Instrument Module describes musical instruments as mediums of performance and their technical properties. Given that numerous taxonomies of instruments into groups and families exist (e.g. Hornbostel-Sachs, MIMO, Mu- sicBrainz) and finding common categorisations is an open problem [1], our module provides an abstraction capable to express arbitrary classifications. This is achieved by leveraging the Information-Realisation and the Collection ODPs. Overall, the module allows to: (i) refer to instruments as entities (an instrumen- tation of a piece for “piano” and “viola”) as well as conceptually (e.g. a viola has 4 strings); (ii) support the integration with different taxonomies and vocabularies, such as [2]; (iii) describe the evolution of instruments in time and space (e.g. a viola as a cultural heritage object being relocated). This provides a foundational level where contributors can “plug” their instrument-specific ontologies [3].
