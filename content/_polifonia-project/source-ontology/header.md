# Source Ontology

Source represents various sources of music-related information. These include=
manuscripts, textbooks, articles, interviews, reviews, comments, memoirs, etc.
of different scope and format (physical, digital). The module aims to provide
general support to describe information related to the creator and type of the
source, the time and place when/where it was created, the context of production
and usage, and the subject and goals. Although this conceptualisa- tion leans
towards bibliographical sources, the module provides expressivity to indicate
multimedia documents (e.g. images of scores, audio recording, video). For
example, a video recording of a performance can be considered as a musical
source â€“ providing documentary evidence of a composition e.g. during an event.
