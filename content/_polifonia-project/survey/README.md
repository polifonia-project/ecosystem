# Survey

The present Survey is structured in three key areas: the first area, the Domain Specific part, facilitates each pilot to focus its needs, wishes, requests and strategies, providing a structured and articulated panorama on sources, methods and outcomes: here, each pilot is asked to identify and to define the characterization of the sources and to list the available digital corpora or datasets. In this respect, this part represents a place for epistemological reflection for the whole Polifonia framework.
The second key area deals with the Technical part of the dataset(s) and has three main goals: 1) to identify the current practices of the consortium in terms of the use of data formats and standards that ensure the expression of the meaning of these data; 2) to identify among the pilots the broad strategies for producing new knowledge and articulating it to existing knowledge in the context of the Web and Linked Open Data for cultural heritage; 3) to identify the software processes and artefacts that will make the data meaningful for users, in particular the expectations in terms of data access and visualization on the Polifonia Web portal, which is the cornerstone of the dissemination and valorisation of the knowledge produced within the project.
The third key area focuses on the Socio-pedagogical aspect of the pilots and/or dataset(s), identifying the target groups (amateurs, musicians, students, etc.) and their conditions (disabilities, specific reference person for the pilotâ€™s socio-pedagogical implications).

This is a work in progress version. It is meant to be developed by each pilot according to its research progress, changes, modifications and so on.
