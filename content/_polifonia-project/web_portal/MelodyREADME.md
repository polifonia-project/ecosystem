# Melody Prototypes

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/370595787.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/370595787)

The repository includes graphic prototypes of the Melody application. It is organised as follows:

 * **analysis** includes annotated competency questions extracted from [Polifonia stories v.1](https://github.com/polifonia-project/stories/releases/tag/v1.0) in the form of csv files, and the exploratory data analysis (Jupyter notebooks) performed to understand the scope of pilots data, the distribution of entities and relations between entities, the information patterns and the cross-connections between Polifonia pilots.
 * **prototypes** include graphic prototypes of the interfaces of the web portal, including templates for creating data stories - to be produced with [MELODY](https://github.com/polifonia-project/dashboard) 
 * **questionnaires** include (1) a preliminary survey with bachelor's students to understand habits and expectations of lay people when consuming music heritage websites and (2) the summary of the evaluation of the graphic prototypes, as a result of focus groupw with music scholars of the Polifonia consortium

Melody is part of [Polifonia](https://polifonia-project.eu/) H2020 project (described in Deliverable 1.9).
