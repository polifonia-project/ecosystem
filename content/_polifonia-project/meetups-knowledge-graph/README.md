# MEETUPS Knowledge Graph

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/588597123.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/588597123)

The MEETUPS knowledge graph contains data about historical encounters of people in the musical world in Europe from c. 1800 to c. 1945.


## Knowledge Graph description

All the data is extracted from artists' biographies, mainly from open-access digital sources such as Wikipedia artists' web pages.
A total of 33,309 biographies were collected for knowledge extraction and construction of the KG.
Currently, the KG contains data on the data extraction of 1000 biographies in the next deliverable. The KG will include data on the total number of biographies collected.
