# MEETUPS Corpus preparation: data cleaning
### MEETUPS Corpus preparation: Cleaning data collected from Wikipedia web pages of people in the music scene in Europe


MEETUPS data cleaning is a tool developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This software prepares the biographies (collected as text files) in https://github.com/polifonia-project/meetups_corpus_collection for the next step in the extraction of historical meetups process.

- Use the Wikipedia authors' webpages collected in https://github.com/polifonia-project/meetups_corpus_collection
- Clean text blank lines, sections with no historical meetups data
- Organise the text in sentences as the main unit to extract meetups information
