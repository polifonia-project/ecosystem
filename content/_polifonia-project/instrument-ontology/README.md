The Instrument Module describes musical instruments as mediums of performance
and their technical properties. Given that numerous taxonomies of instruments
into groups and families exist (e.g. Hornbostel-Sachs, MIMO, Mu- sicBrainz) and
finding common categorisations is an open problem [1], our module provides an
abstraction capable to express arbitrary classifications. This is achieved by
leveraging the Information-Realisation and the Collection ODPs. Overall, the
module allows to: (i) refer to instruments as entities (an instrumen- tation of
a piece for ‚Äúpiano‚Äù and ‚Äúviola‚Äù) as well as conceptually (e.g. a viola has 4
strings); (ii) support the integration with different taxonomies and
vocabularies, such as [2]; (iii) describe the evolution of instruments in time
and space (e.g. a viola as a cultural heritage object being relocated).
This provides a foundational level where contributors can ‚Äúplug‚Äù their
instrument-specific ontologies [3].

## Competency questions addressed
- Which is the physical realization of an instrument?
- Which are the parts of an instrument?
- Who invented an instrument?
- When was an instrument invented?
- Where was an instrument realization built?
- When was an instrument realization built?
- Who built an instrument realization?
- Which is the current location of an instrument realization?
- Which are the locations of an instrument realization during its life cycle?

## Competency questions planned


## Examples of SPARQL queries
- Which is the physical realization of an instrument?
```
PREFIX inst: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/instrument/>
PREFIX core: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/core/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?instrument ?instrumentRealization
WHERE { ?instrument core:isRealizedBy ?instrumentRealization .
}
```

- Who invented an instrument?
```
PREFIX inst: <https://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/instrument/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?instrument ?builder
WHERE { ?instrument mi:wasInventedBy ?builder .
}
```
