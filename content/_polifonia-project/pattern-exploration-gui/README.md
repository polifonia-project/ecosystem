# Music Pattern Exploration - Frontend Server

## Description

This repository contains the frontend server for the Music Pattern Exploration project. The frontend is built using Vue.js (@vue/cli 5.0.8) and communicates with a separate Python backend server for data. It features a search home page and a tune page.

This software forms part of Polifonia Deliverable D5.6.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Vue CLI 5.0.8

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
