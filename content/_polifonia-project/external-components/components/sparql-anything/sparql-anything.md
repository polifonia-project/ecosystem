# SPARQL Anything

[SPARQL Anything](http://sparql-anything.eu) is a system for Semantic Web re-engineering that allows users to ... query anything with SPARQL.

Main features:
- Query files in plain SPARQL 1.1, via the `SERVICE <x-sparql-anything:>` (see [configuration](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuration)) and build knowledge graphs with `CONSTRUCT` queries
- [Supported formats](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-formats): XML, JSON, CSV, HTML, Excel, Text, Binary, EXIF, File System, Zip/Tar, Markdown, YAML, Bibtex, DOCx (see [configuration](#format-specific-options))
- Transforms [files, inline content, or the output of an external command](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#general-purpose-options)
- Full fledged [HTTP client](#http-options) to query Web APIs (headers, authentication, all methods supported)
- [Functions library](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#functions-and-magic-properties) for RDF sequences, strings, hashes, easy entity building, ...
- Combine multiple SERVICE clauses into complex data integration queries (thanks to SPARQL)
- Query templates (using [BASIL variables](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#query-templates-and-variable-bindings))
- Save and reuse SPARQL `Results Sets` as input for [parametric queries](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#query-templates-and-variable-bindings)
- Slice large CSV files with an iterator-like execution style (soon [JSON](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/issues/202) and [XML](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/issues/203))
- Supports an [on-disk option](https://sparql-anything.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#general-purpose-options) (with Apache Jena TDB2)

SPARQL Anything is developed in collaboration with the EU-funded project [SPICE](http://spice-h2020.eu).
