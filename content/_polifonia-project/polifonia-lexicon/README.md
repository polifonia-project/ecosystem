# Polifonia Lexicon

### The Polifonia Multilingual WordNet

This repository contains the annotation files for the Polifonia musical lexicon in English (EN), French (FR), Italian (IT), Spanish (ES), German (EN) and Dutch (NL). The lexicon was created selecting from **[BabelNet domains](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babeldomains/)** all the **[WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu)** musical synsets.

V1. BabelNet domains synsets were manually validated, discarding nonpertinent concepts and lexicalizations.

V2. Missing lexicalizations were added by professional translators.
