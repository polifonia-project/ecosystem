The Bells Ontology makes it possible to describe bells, bell towers and bell ringers.
Bells, which are the main subject of this module, are described by means of measurable, intrinsic aspects such as weight, materials, conservation status, as well as properties deriving from interpretation situations, such as authorship attribution, dating, execution techniques, and their related objects (e.g. bibliography).
The Bell ontology modules reuses and extends the ArCo ontology network.

## Imported ontologies

### External Imports
- [ArCo Ontology network](https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco)


## Statistics
Considering that, apart from the definition of some novel classes inside the module (such as Bell, SetOfBells, and BellTower), the BELL module widely relies on the ArCo ontology network, we report here useful statistics of ArCo: 
- number of classes: 340 
- number of object properties: 616
- number of datatype properties: 154
- number of logical axioms: 3,416

## Datasets
Data about two sets of bells, modelled according to the imported ArCo ontology network, have been published so far:
- https://w3id.org/arco/resource/MusicHeritage/0700377972-0 (68 triples)
- https://w3id.org/arco/resource/MusicHeritage/0700377973-0 (68 triples)

Relevant properties describing a set of bells are:
- arco:numberOfComponents (how many bells are in the church?)
- a-loc:hasTimeIndexedTypedLocation (are there bells in the church?)
- a-dd:hasMaterial (which is the material of the bell?)
- a-cd:hasAuthor / a-cd:hasPreferredAuthor / a-cd:hasAuthorshipAttribution (by whom (by which foundry) were they cast?)
- a-cd:hasDating (in which year were they cast?)
- a-dd:hasMeasurementCollection (which is the weight of the bell?, which are the measures of the bell?)
