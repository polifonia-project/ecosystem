The Patterns Knowledge Graph contains data about patterns in multiple corpora of folk / traditional music. The patterns are those extracted using the [FONN tools](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis).

The Patterns Knowledge Graph is used by the [Pattern Exploration GUI](https://github.com/polifonia-project/pattern-exploration-gui) via the [Pattern Exploration GUI backend](https://github.com/polifonia-project/pattern-explorations-backend).
