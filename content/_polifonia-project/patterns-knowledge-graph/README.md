# Abstract and highlights
The Patterns Knowledge Graph contains data about patterns in folk / traditional music. The patterns are those extracted using the [FONN tools](https://github.com/polifonia-project/folk_ngram_analysis).

* Allows exploration of patterns as linked open data
* Multiple corpora, multiple definitions of patterns (e.g. $n$=(4, 5, 6), accent-level versus note-level)
* Running public SPARQL endpoint and MELODY data stories as demonstrations.

## Data Sources
The PatternKG currently contains pattern data extracted from two important repositories:

* MTC-ANN, Meertens Tune Collections - Annotated. This set of 360 tunes from the Dutch folk tradition contains tune family annotations. See https://www.liederenbank.nl/mtc/
* The Session (annotated subset). This set of 315 tunes in 10 tune families is from the Irish folk tradition. The Session itself is 40k tunes, crowd-sourced. This subset has been chosen and annotated with tune family information based on the musicological literature. See https://thesession.org/ for the original (large) collection. 
 
The tune family annotation of *The Session* (315 tunes) is published here for the first time. It was carried out by Danny Diamond based on the musicological literature with extensive manual checking.


## Requirements and installation

1. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries. They are:

```
PyYAML
rdflib
jams
```

2. You will also need to install SPARQL-Anything. We are currently using version 0.6.0 (see https://github.com/polifonia-project/patterns-knowledge-graph/issues/1). Download the 0.6.0 jar file from: https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/releases, and copy it to the `sparql-anything` directory here in the `patterns-knowledge-graph` repo.

## Running the software

Then, you can run the software by running:

```
cd P2KG-Pipeline
python pattern2kg_pipeline.py
```

It will read the data (metadata in csv format, and pattern occurrences in pickle format) from `inputs/`. It will write out the knowledge graph to the `RDF` directory in `.ttl` files.

We then copy this to the Polifonia server https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/fonn/sparql, which provides the data via a public SPARQL endpoint. We also provide some data stories via MELODY:

* https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/fonn/statistics_on_the_session_annotated_subset_and_meertens_tune_collections_mtcann_pattern_kg
* https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/fonn/tune_families_in_the_session_and_mtcann

Anyone can create new MELODY data stories, using the same SPARQL endpoint. See https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/ for more information.

## Bringing your own data

If you have pattern information and metadata representing some new corpus, you can copy it to a subdirectory in `inputs/` before starting, and it will be processed. The metadata should be in csv format, with at least an `identifiers` field (string), a `title` field (string; can be empty), and a `tune family` field (string).
