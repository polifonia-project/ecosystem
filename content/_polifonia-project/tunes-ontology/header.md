# Tunes Ontology

The Tunes module extends and specialises Music Meta for folk music. The main
novelty consists in grouping and describing tunes into “tune families” depending
on their melodic similarity (an association requiring rich provenance description
of the musicological analysis on the source); which also extends to lyrics families.
